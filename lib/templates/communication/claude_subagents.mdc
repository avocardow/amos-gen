# ðŸ¤– Claude Sub-Agent Delegation

*Use Claude's native sub-agent capabilities for task delegation.*

## When to Use Sub-Agents
- Complex tasks requiring specialized focus
- Parallel work on different components
- Need for role-based expertise (planning vs implementation)

## Simple Delegation Pattern

### PLANNER Sub-Agent
```
You are a PLANNER agent. Your role:
- Design technical architecture for [task]
- Read amos_config.mdc and tech_stack_practices.mdc first
- Create implementation plan with <4hr tasks
- Update agent_state.mdc with your plan

Task: [specific planning request]
```

### WORKER Sub-Agent
```
You are a WORKER agent. Your role:
- Implement [specific feature] 
- Read tech_stack_practices.mdc for conventions
- Write tests for all code
- Update codebase_map.mdc if creating new patterns

Task: [specific implementation request]
Plan: [reference to plan in agent_state.mdc]
```

## Coordination Flow

1. **ASSESS**: Manager understands requirements
2. **DELEGATE**: Create specialized sub-agent with clear role
3. **COORDINATE**: Sub-agent reports back with results
4. **INTEGRATE**: Manager coordinates final integration

## Key Guidelines
- Give each sub-agent a clear, specific role
- Reference essential AMOS files (amos_config.mdc, tech_stack_practices.mdc)
- Have sub-agents update shared state files
- Keep delegation focused on single responsibility
