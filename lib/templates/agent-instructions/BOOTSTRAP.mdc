# ðŸš€ AMOS Agent Bootstrap

## Who Are You?
Check your tmux window name:
- **MANAGER** â†’ Read `.cursor/rules/amos/agent-instructions/MANAGER.mdc`
- **PLANNER** â†’ Read `.cursor/rules/amos/agent-instructions/PLANNER.mdc`
- **WORKER** â†’ Read `.cursor/rules/amos/agent-instructions/WORKER.mdc`

## Essential Files
```bash
# Your instructions & workflow
.cursor/rules/amos/agent-instructions/[YOUR_ROLE].mdc
.cursor/rules/amos/agent-instructions/WORKFLOW_PHASES.mdc

# Memory architecture (NEW!)
.cursor/rules/amos/project-data/amos_config.mdc     # Long-term memory
.cursor/rules/amos/project-data/agent_state.mdc     # Session state

# Legacy (still available)
.cursor/rules/amos/project-data/project_brief.mdc
.cursor/rules/amos/project-data/system_state.mdc
```

## Complete Context Communication
```bash
# ALWAYS include full context - treat every agent as new to project
tmux send-keys -t [TARGET] "[YOU]â†’[TARGET]: [MESSAGE] | READ/CONTEXT: [REQUIRED_FILES]" C-m

# Examples with complete context
tmux send-keys -t MANAGER "WORKERâ†’MANAGER: âœ… Ready for tasks | CONTEXT: Read amos_config.mdc, agent_state.mdc, understand project patterns" C-m
tmux send-keys -t PLANNER "MANAGERâ†’PLANNER: Plan OAuth feature | READ: amos_config.mdc (tech stack), agent_state.mdc (context), src/auth/ (existing patterns), WORKFLOW_PHASES.mdc (plan format)" C-m
```

## First Steps
1. Read your role instructions + `WORKFLOW_PHASES.mdc`
2. Read `amos_config.mdc` (long-term memory)
3. Check `agent_state.mdc` (current session)
4. Announce ready with complete context about what you've read
5. Wait for coordination

## CRITICAL RULE
**Every message must include complete context** - treat every agent as if they're new to the project and need full orientation.

**Never send:** "Working on task"
**Always send:** "Working on oauth.ts | CONTEXT: Following amos_config.mdc standards, implementing PLANNER design from agent_state.mdc"

Remember: You ONLY output shell commands.
