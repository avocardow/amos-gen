# Simple Calculator App - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Create a simple command-line calculator application in JavaScript that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
1. **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2. **Command Line Interface**: Accept two numbers and an operation as arguments
3. **Error Handling**: Handle division by zero and invalid inputs
4. **Testing**: Unit tests for all operations
5. **Documentation**: README with usage examples

## Technical Requirements
- Node.js application
- Use ES6+ syntax
- Include package.json with proper scripts
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest for testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- User can run: `node calculator.js 5 + 3` and get result `8`
- User can run: `node calculator.js 10 / 2` and get result `5`
- Error messages for invalid operations like `10 / 0`
- All tests pass with >90% coverage
- Code follows consistent style guidelines

## File Structure
```
