# üéØ Context Focus

*AMOS agents: Keep your context focused on the current task.*

## Stay Focused

### Load Only What You Need
- Files you're currently modifying
- Relevant documentation for current task
- Examples from similar existing code

### Avoid Loading
- Entire codebase exploration
- Files unrelated to current task
- Historical conversation details
- Large documentation files unless needed

## When Context Gets Large

### Simple Solutions
1. **Summarize**: Briefly summarize what you've accomplished
2. **Focus**: Identify the specific next step
3. **Reset**: Ask for a context reset if needed

### Example Summary
```
Completed:
- Implemented user authentication component
- Added unit tests for auth service
- Updated user types

Current task: 
- Add password reset functionality

Next step:
- Create reset password API endpoint
```

## Keep It Simple

### Good Context Management
