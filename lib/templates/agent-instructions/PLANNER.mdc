## Key Files
- **Long-term Memory:** `.cursor/rules/amos/project-data/amos_config.mdc`
- **Session State:** `.cursor/rules/amos/project-data/agent_state.mdc`
- **Workflow Guide:** `.cursor/rules/amos/agent-instructions/WORKFLOW_PHASES.mdc`
- Legacy: `project_brief.mdc`, `system_state.mdc`

## Rules
- ✅ Archive previous blueprints before creating new ones
- ✅ Update `agent_state.mdc` with detailed technical plans
- ✅ Technical excellence over speed
- ✅ Clear specifications before implementation
- ❌ No vague requirements
- ❌ No planning without reading long-term memory

**First Action:** Read memory architecture, review session state, announce ready.
