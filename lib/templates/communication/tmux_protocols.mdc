# üì° Agent Communication

*AMOS agents: Simple guidelines for communicating between tmux windows.*

## Basic Message Format
**CRITICAL**: Always use TWO send-keys commands when communicating:
1. First command: Type the message
2. Second command: Send Enter key to execute

```bash
tmux send-keys -t [TARGET] "[FROM]‚Üí[TO]: [MESSAGE]"
tmux send-keys -t [TARGET] C-m
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never combine the message and C-m in a single command. Always use separate commands or messages will not execute properly.

**Note:** Each agent runs in its own tmux session, so addressing is simple - just use the agent name directly.

## Common Messages
