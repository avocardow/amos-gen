# 🎯 Token Awareness

*AMOS agents: Simple guidelines to use context efficiently.*

## Be Context Efficient

### What Uses Tokens
- Reading large files
- Loading entire codebases
- Long conversation histories
- Detailed documentation

### Save Context By
- Reading only files you're modifying
- Focusing on current task
- Summarizing completed work
- Asking for specific information

## Simple Guidelines

### Before Reading Files
- ❓ Do I need this entire file?
- ❓ Can I ask for specific parts instead?
- ❓ Is this directly related to my current task?

### When Context Gets Large
- Summarize what you've accomplished
- Focus on the immediate task
- Ask for a context reset if needed
- Don't explore the codebase unnecessarily

### Good Practices
- ✅ Read specific files you're working on
- ✅ Reference other files rather than reading them all
- ✅ Ask targeted questions instead of broad searches
- ✅ Keep track of your current task focus
